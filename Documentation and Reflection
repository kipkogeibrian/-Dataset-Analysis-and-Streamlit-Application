                                          Challenges Faced:
Data Quality: The CORD-19 dataset contains many missing values, especially in the abstract and journal columns.

Date Processing: The publish_time column had inconsistent formats that needed careful handling.

Text Processing: Cleaning and analyzing text data required careful handling of punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.

Streamlit Deployment: Creating an interactive app that responds to user inputs while maintaining performance.



                                          Key Learnings:
Data Cleaning: Gained experience in handling missing data and converting data types.

Text Analysis: Learned how to process text data and extract insights using word frequency and word clouds.

Visualization: Created various visualizations to communicate patterns in the data effectively.

Interactive Apps: Built a functional Streamlit application that allows users to explore the data dynamically.




                                          Insights from the Data:
Publication Trends: COVID-19 research publications increased dramatically in 2020 and remained high in subsequent years.

Journal Distribution: A small number of journals published a large proportion of COVID-19 research.

Common Themes: The most frequent words in titles reflect the main research focus areas like "COVID", "patients", "health", and "pandemic".



                                          How to Run the Streamlit App:
Save the Streamlit code as app.py

Make sure the metadata.csv file is in the same directory

Install required libraries: `pip install streamlit pandas
